These are the five files necessary for a bare menu system (four nodes and Main.cpp). You will need to create the node
files (RootNode.h, HighscoresNode.h, GameMenuNode.h, OptionsNode.h) in the source directory of your project and then
copy-paste the code from here. Then, copy-paste the code from this Main.cpp into your Main.cpp.

I will add comments to these to help you understand how they work but for know just play around with it and see what happens!

Once you get the hang of it and have an idea roughly of what is going on you can customize this menu and make it your own. 

If you want to add your own images make sure they are .png and put them under the correct folder under source. For example if you wanted to
make the background for the rootNode different you would paste some "image.png" into "source/rootNodeImages" and then in the code specify 
the path to this image with "rootNodeImages/image.png"
