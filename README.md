# Arcade_System_Project_Lessons

This repository contains the source code from each lesson as well as the nodes for the menu and completed arcade system. 

A few things to note:

IMPORTANT
1. These folders only contain the new source code for each lesson, NOT a fully working project. This means you need to
   follow the instructions for lesson 0 to setup a working base project before using this code. The base code is at these repos:
   https://github.com/geffencooper/ArcadeSystem_windows
   https://github.com/geffencooper/ArcadeSystem_mac

2. Lesson 0, 1, 2 are about setting up the development environment and designing and implementing the menu system. These lessons are identical
   for Fall and Winter and the only source code is in lesson 2. The full menu system is under the "bare_menu_files" folder and 
   contains the code for a fully implemented menu with multiple nodes and screens.
   
3. A fully implemented arcade system can be found as well. Again, this contains only the source files and you will need to 
   set up everything as shown in lesson 0 for these files to compile. You can clone this repo and just copy all the source files
   into the repo you have configured and set up after lesson 0.
